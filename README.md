# Personal Website
This is my personal website written using React-Bootstrap. Check it out here: http://www.jonathanfan.site/

### Using this template
If you would like to use this repo template: clone it. All you have to do is make sure you have Node.js and React.js installed on your local computer and make a new react app. From here there are some notable packages that you must install such as React-Bootstrap and some others ones as well. Afterwards just run **npm start** to view it in a localhost deployment server.
